# Regex-explained

This repo contains a gist of a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. Ive chosen a Regex which will run through and match looking for a HTML in a body of writing. The gist will go through and breakdown the components that make up the regex expression, and even touch on some things that arent included within the expression itself but are commonly found within regex expressions.
